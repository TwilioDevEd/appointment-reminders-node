# Appointment Reminders. Powered by Twilio - Node.js/Express

[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/TwilioDevEd/appointment-reminders-node.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TwilioDevEd/appointment-reminders-node)


Use Twilio to create automatic appointment reminders for your business users. For a step-by-step tutorial click [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/tutorials/walkthrough/appointment-reminders/node/express).


## Local development

First you need to install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

1. This sample application stores data in a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) database using [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/). You can   download and run MongoDB yourself (on OS X, Linux or Windows).

   On OS X, maybe the easiest way to get MongoDB running locally is to install it via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

   ```bash
   $ brew install mongodb
   ```
   You should then be able to run a local server with:

   ```bash
   $ mongod
   ```

To run the app locally:

1. Clone this repository and `cd` into it

   ```bash
   $ git clone git@github.com:TwilioDevEd/appointment-reminders-node.git

   $ cd appointment-reminders-node
   ```

1. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    $ npm install
    ```

1. Copy the sample configuration file and edit it to match your configuration

   ```bash
   $ cp .env .env.local
   ```
   You can find your `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` in your
   [Twilio Account Settings](https://www.twilio.com/console).
   You will also need a `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`, which you may find [here](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming).

   Run `source .env.local` to export the environment variables

1. Run the application

    ```bash
    $ npm start
    ```
    Alternatively you might also consider using [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) for this. It works just like
    the node command but automatically restarts your application when you change any source code files.

    ```bash
    $ npm install -g nodemon
    $ nodemon ./bin/www
    ```

1. Check it out at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

That's it

## Run the tests

You can run the tests locally by typing

```bash
$ npm run test
```
